### 🎯 Tips for a Strong README

Here’s what makes a README effective:

- **Short intro:** What is this?  
- **Features:** What it does  
- **Tech stack:** Tools used  
- **Usage instructions:** Install & run steps  
- **Customization tips:** Where to edit content  
- **Deploy guidance:** How to host online  
- **License & contributions:** Legal + community

Including these makes your project easy to understand for collaborators or recruiters browsing your GitHub. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

If you want, I can also help you generate **social preview images**, **badges (like GitHub Actions / Vercel build status)**, or a **GitHub profile README** that links to this project! 🎨
